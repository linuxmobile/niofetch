**_A new Neofetch written in Amber!_**

</div>

## ❓ Why?

**NioFetch** arose from the need to have an equivalent to its predecessor [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) and the main problem surrounding it: **maintenance**. **Neofetch** is written in **Bash** in a _single file of eleven thousand lines_, which makes it little to **not maintainable** in the long term.

This time, with the passage of time in mind and the need to create a **more maintainable successor**, a new and modern language is used that allows for an almost direct equivalent in its output: [Amber](https://github.com/amber-lang/amber).

**Amber** is a _scripting programming language_ that compiles to **Bash**, allowing code to be written that follows an _ECMA-based convention_ and generates an equally **efficient output**.
